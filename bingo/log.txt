01/04/22
- Working on the function that will return 'X' in case the drawed number match one of the numbers in the bingo card

- I used the array method .every() on lineComplete() and bingo() functions in order to check if all the elements on the array were equal to 'X'
- On arrow functions:
    for named functions we treat arrow expressions like variables:

    // Traditional Function
    function bob (a){
    return a + 100;
    }

    // Arrow Function
    let bob = a => a + 100;

- Used the loop 'for of' in the block to test the completion of a line, with 'X', on the main() function. Differently from 'for in' loop, 'for of' returns the element itself and not it's index.
- Line 161 is not being accessed by the code and I can't understand why.

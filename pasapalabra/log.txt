- Show results on screen:
    I found 2 ways to see the results of the functions you develop:
        1. Open the html project, create a div (or similar), link with js using getElementById and setting this div equal to whatever you want to see on screen.
        2. The other method is to open dev tools (inspect) on the website of the project (html), select the console part and use console.log on the js file to see the results on the console.

- Attention to the variables names!! Something might not be working well if even a letter of a variable name is not correct.

- In order to change between players, we can reassign the player variable to the player name and change the loops 

- I started creating 2 main functions, one for each player to change between players. On the next iteration I included on the first function also the logic to change turn to the second player. On the next iteration I changed the player object (on createPlayers function) so they could have all the necessary keys to change turns the most simple way I could imagine. So after all I have just one function with one main block that changes between players' objects and access all the information on each object. That way each player has it's own name, index, points, fails, questions passed and 'end' count.

- The key concept lerned with this task was to use objects in order to store all the information you need for each player separately (properties of the object).
